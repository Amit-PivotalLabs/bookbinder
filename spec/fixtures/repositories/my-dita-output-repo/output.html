        <p class="p"> GemFire XD enables applications to manage data entirely in memory by using partitioning and
            synchronous replication to distribute the data across numerous GemFire XD members. </p>

    </div>

    <div class="section"><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Seamless Integration of In-Memory data with Persistent Stores</h2>

        <p class="p">GemFire XD provides an optimized local disk persistence mechanism with a non-flushing
            algorithm to maintain high performance in applications that require stable,
            long-term storage. Applications can also use GemFire XD to actively cache table data
            from a traditional disk-based RDBMS.</p>

        <p class="p">For big data applications, GemFire XD enables you to extend the local disk
            persistence mechanism with persistence to HDFS. You can either configure HDFS as a
            destination for capturing all writes to a GemFire XD table, or you can configure
            HDFS as a read/write storage tier for caching in-memory data. In this later
            application, GemFire XD automatically retrieves data from HDFS as necessary to
            satisfy SQL queries when data is not available in memory.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="section" id="concept_CC1CB22BF12749D99D3B853E2505263C__section_F6F082BD2D9545F3A6465C7F075D3D97"><a name="concept_CC1CB22BF12749D99D3B853E2505263C__section_F6F082BD2D9545F3A6465C7F075D3D97"><!-- --></a><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Continuous Availability, Elastically Scaled, Low Latency </h2>

        <p class="p">A flexible architecture enables GemFire XD to pool memory and disk
            resources from hundreds of clustered members. This clustered approach provides
            extremely high throughput, predictable latency, dynamic and linear scalability,
            and continuous availability of data. By collocating application logic with data
            and executing application logic in parallel, GemFire XD substantially increases
            application throughput. It also transparently re-executes application logic if
            a server fails.

    <div class="section" id="concept_CC1CB22BF12749D99D3B853E2505263C__section_8722B7E997C5410FA031BDF5E4B96DFF"><a name="concept_CC1CB22BF12749D99D3B853E2505263C__section_8722B7E997C5410FA031BDF5E4B96DFF"><!-- --></a><h2 class="title sectiontitle">Highly Adaptable to Existing Applications</h2>

        <p class="p"> GemFire XD is implemented entirely in Java, and it can be embedded directly within a Java
            application. You can also deploy GemFire XD members as standalone servers that
            participate in a cluster. Java applications can connect to a GemFire XD cluster
            using the provided JDBC drivers. Microsoft .NET and Mono applications can connect
            using the provided ADO.NET driver, and GemFire XD also provides an ODBC-compliant
            driver.</p>

        <p class="p">The use of SQL, JDBC, ODBC, and ADO.NET means that many existing database applications can be easily
            adapted to use a GemFire XD cluster. GemFire XD introduces several extensions to
            common SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) statements to manage data partitioning,
            replication, synchronization with data sources, and other features. However, most
            common queries and Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements are based on ANSI
            SQL-92, so experienced database application developers can use their knowledge of
            SQL when working with GemFire XD. </p>

With GemFire XD you can manage data entirely using in-memory tables, or you can persist very large tables to local disk store files or to a Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) for big data deployments. In this initial release, GemFire XD provides a low-latency SQL interface to in-memory table data, while seamlessly integrating data that is persisted in HDFS. A single GemFire XD distributed system can be easily scaled out using commodity hardware to support thousands of concurrent clients, and you can also replicate data between distinct GemFire XD clusters over a WAN interface. GemFire XD also provides easy access to persisted HDFS data using tools in the Pivotal HD ecosystem such as MapReduce or HAWQ (using the GemFire XD PXF driver that is installed with HAWQ).">Overview of Pivotal GemFire XD</a></div>
