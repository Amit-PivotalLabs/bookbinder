    image library, like RMagick. It tries to be memory efficient and reasonably fast.
    
    It supports reading and writing all PNG variants that are defined in the specification, 
    with one limitation: only 8-bit color depth is supported. It supports all transparency, 
    interlacing and filtering options the PNG specifications allows. It can also read and 
    write textual metadata from PNG files. Low-level read/write access to PNG chunks is
    also possible.
    
    This library supports simple drawing on the image canvas and simple operations like
    alpha composition and cropping. Finally, it can import from and export to RMagick for 
    interoperability.
    
    Also, have a look at OilyPNG at http://github.com/wvanbergen/oily_png. OilyPNG is a

of EventMachine is to enable programs to easily interface with other programs

mime-types,2.1,MIT,The mime-types library provides a library and registry for information about MIME content type definitions,"The mime-types library provides a library and registry for information about
MIME content type definitions. It can be used to determine defined filename
extensions for MIME types, or to use filename extensions to look up the likely
MIME type definitions.

MIME content types are used in MIME-compliant communications, as in e-mail or
HTTP traffic, to indicate the type of content which is transmitted. The
mime-types library provides the ability for detailed information about MIME
entities (provided as an enumerable collection of MIME::Type objects) to be
determined and used programmatically. There are many types defined by RFCs and
vendors, so the list is long but by definition incomplete; don't hesitate to to
add additional type definitions (see Contributing.rdoc). The primary sources
for MIME type definitions found in mime-types is the IANA collection of
registrations (see below for the link), RFCs, and W3C recommendations.

This is release 2.1, mostly changing how the MIME type registry is updated from
the IANA registry (the format of which was incompatibly changed shortly before
this release) and taking advantage of the extra data available from IANA
registry in the form of MIME::Type#xrefs. In addition, the {LTSW
list}[http://www.ltsw.se/knbase/internet/mime.htp] has been dropped as a
supported list.

As a reminder, mime-types 2.x is no longer compatible with Ruby 1.8 and
mime-types 1.x is only being maintained for security issues. No new MIME types
or features will be added.

mime-types (previously called MIME::Types for Ruby) was originally based on
MIME::Types for Perl by Mark Overmeer, copyright 2001 - 2009. It is built to
conform to the MIME types of RFCs 2045 and 2231. It tracks the {IANA Media
Types registry}[https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml]
with some types added by the users of mime-types."
